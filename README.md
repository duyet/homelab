# Homelab Project

This personal project is aimed at running a homelab on my Raspberry Pi, MiniPC and old Android phone. 
It includes several components such as Airflow, some automation tools written in Rust, and a dashboard for monitoring things.

Most of the configuration files and data schema are open and can be found in the this repo.
